Git Workflow and Branching Model
--------------------------------

We use [GitHub Flow][3], meaning that the `master` branch should always
be ready for release and all new work is done in descriptively named
branches off of `master`, which are then reviewed via pull requests. The
only addition is that we do still have a `release` branch that always
points to the latest versioned release. We also use tags like `6.0` to
tag each release.
